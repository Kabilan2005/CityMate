Dont consider front end as of now We are going to code Backend alone.
First Module : Users

Need Step by Step: 
    Like in other apps i Need the following:
        Login / Signup page what i need is like in other apps the users signup and log in the first time after that the log in remains there everytime i need that one.
        When the django app link is opened if the user is already registered it lands in the home page else lands on the sign up page with google sign up, or email with verification code sent to them via the email or via phone number where an otp is sent to them then they can land in the home page

first let us finish up the authentication (users) module. the flow i needed is evrytime when a client requests a server he lands in the get started page if he didnt already have logged in or else he must land at the home page. After Getting started page he or she can click any one of the login or sign up buttons redirected accordingly. The Getting Started Page consists of the Welcome quote and little about us in a fashioned colored way use light vibrant attractive colors and design use extensive CSS stylings that should be very pleasantable. the sign up page consists of a form username the uniqueness should be ensured. then email or mobile number box where he can enter any one after this there must be a verification button on clicking that he/she will be redirected to verification page on clicking the otp or verification code is send to his / her mobile or email accordingly after verification is done he lands on the set password page on which he is asked to enter password twice in two seperate boxes for confirmation it must meet the standard constraints after he set the password he lands in the login page where he enters username/email/phone and password to enter. In the login page the user can see two options one for forgot password ? then reset password ! . On clicking he lands in the forgot password page where he is authenticated via the same verification page after he or she lands in the new password page which follows the same structure as set passwrod page. On clicking reset we will handle that later.Code the users folder completely with all these features with optimal code where i need all the logic. before coding state the logic once again since i need the entire functionality.

the places app where first i need the base html to be modified that is the base for all other pages after logged in where the user land on the home page. The home page consists of a navigation bar at the bottom where it contains icons for home, magnifying glass redirecting to filter and search page, Profile page to view their deatils and their activity like in instagram, add place page and add review page icons. The home page should be pleasant. then the home page consists of recommendations where we have trained a model for it dont care about that as of now but add row for recommendations and one row for trending places and one row based on near by locations. Each place row is displayed as a grid and each palce is given a box structure where the image covers 60% of the space, then name and location, rating. Use data from the folder that is uploaded here and includes tags too in their models. Need all the details from the files since i need all the features. Then the filter and search [age contains options for filtering location, rating, price tier, time and other stuff and then search based on food, name, etc. Then the add place page is a form that asks users to enter details and allows to upload photos from their system. Then the review page allows users to select a place and write reviews accordinlgy and rate them too. All these pages should have pleasant and food appealing and stay appealing themes of colors. Recite the idea without coding for confirmation.
